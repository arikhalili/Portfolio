<p> COMMENT FROM MARIANA VASQUEZ--i learned how to write python and made atom to draw any shape i want. I made a computer do what  i tell it to do in the language it speaks.
   that is pretty freaaking cool. i feel  more and more like a coder seeing the things i type in the computer turn into commands and seeing the words turn different colors making sure that i am right
   the difference between  python and scratch is the block coding and having to write down specifically each command and making mistakes of a period and a () in the wrong place.
   they teach  us loops and variables in both and it makes sense they are similar in that way. it felt like i was making progress running the program and seeing where the error was. 
  i like that feeling.</p>
